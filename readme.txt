Welcome to Spotitector (Spotify-emotion-detector)!
    Hello! 

    Welcome to Spotitector, an app that tries (its best) to brighten your
    day! Simply show us how you are looking right now and we will recommend a
    song so that you can feel better.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
    Spotitector is an application that runs off of TKinter [ver: 2.21.0]. 
    The app uses the Facial Emotion Recognition Library (FER) and Spotipy 
    library. The functionality of this app is to recognize the user's emotion 
    through the computer's camera or by uploading an image. Then the app will 
    recommend a song for the user to listen to based on their mood, which the 
    user can choose to listen to on Spotify. 

MODULES REQUIRED:
    -   FER
    -   Spotipy (v: 2.21.0)
    -   Tkinter
    -   Matplotlib
    -   PIL
    -   webbrowser
    -   request
    -   io

HOW TO USE:
    To run the project, run the app.py file. The terminal should start loading
    songs into the programâ€“this will take some time. Once The songs are
    finished loading, a TKinter window should pop up. From there, use the
    buttons to navigate the app.
